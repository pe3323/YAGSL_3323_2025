# Yet Another Generic Swerve Library
* In early 2023 `swerve-lib` created by SwerveDriveSpecialties officially became unmaintained after not being updated in 2022.
* This library aims to simplify Swerve Drive implementations while not sacrificing speed or processing power.

# [Features](https://github.com/BroncBotz3481/YAGSL-Example/discussions/29)
* The swerve drive is configurable via JSON files, and you can initialize the entire swerve drive with a similar line as the following.
* Simulation support.
```java
import edu.wpi.first.math.util.Units;

SwerveDrive swerveDrive=new SwerveParser(new File(Filesystem.getDeployDirectory(),"swerve")).createSwerveDrive(Units.feetToMeters(14.5));
```
* The library is located in [swervelib/](./swervelib) with documentation in [docs/](./docs) and example JSON in [deploy](./deploy).
* Support for [NetworkAlerts](https://github.com/Mechanical-Advantage/NetworkAlerts/) for use in Shuffleboard.

# Discussions
* Latest resources and features will be posted on the discusions page [here](https://github.com/BroncBotz3481/YAGSL-Example/discussions).

# Special Thanks to Team 7900! Trial N' Error
Without the debugging and aid of Team 7900 the project could never be as stable or active as it is.

# Special Thanks to Team 6238! Popcorn Penguins!
Without their hardwork debugging the issue with feedforwards the 2024 release would not have been possible. Thank you!
